**Tools Used:** SQL, Power BI, Excel

Prism has been recently acquired by Quadrangle, a large corporation with ambitious growth goals. Quadrangle has identified that Prism lacks a unified platform that provides real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) and crucial metrics. As a result, critical business decisions are currently being made based on incomplete or anecdotal information. To address this gap, we want you to develop a dashboard that serves as a single source of truth for tracking and monitoring the overall health of Prism. As part of your team's responsibilities, you will be required to define key metrics, design wireframes, and ultimately develop a dashboard that can be used by management and various stakeholders in the business. You also need to present your key findings in a 10 minute presentation with slides to the executive team
