**Context**

Prism has been recently acquired by Quadrangle, a large corporation with ambitious growth goals. Quadrangle has identified that Prism lacks a unified platform that provides real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) and crucial metrics. As a result, critical business decisions are currently being made based on incomplete or anecdotal information. To address this gap, we want you to develop a dashboard that serves as a single source of truth for tracking and monitoring the overall health of Prism. As part of your team's responsibilities, you will be required to define key metrics, design wireframes, and ultimately develop a dashboard that can be used by management and various stakeholders in the business. You also need to present your key findings in a 10 minute presentation with slides to the executive team

**Deliverables**


**Dashboard**
  Create a management dashboard with key metrics and insights - the ultimate goal is to provide a holistic view of our business, allowing stakeholders to assess its performance, identify trends, and uncover opportunities for improvement

**Documentation**
  Create a document that defines the metrics that will be showcased in your dashboard. Clearly outline the calculations and data sources used to derive each metric

**Presentation**
  Create a slide deck to the executive team on the key insights and recommendations derived from the dashboard - What Prism has done well and what should they change. Summarise the performance of our business across various metrics and identify any noteworthy trends or patterns. Offer recommendations based on the insights gained
