# data_analytics_portfolio
I'm excited to share my Data Analytics portfolio, where I showcase a range of projects applying skills in SQL, Power BI, Excel, and Google BigQuery. This portfolio highlights work across data extraction, cleaning, visualization, and insight generation, with a focus on solving real business problems.

The projects featured demonstrate my ability to build dynamic dashboards, track key performance indicators (KPIs), analyse marketing campaign data, and model data for efficient reporting. Each project reflects my commitment to accuracy, data integrity, and clear communication of insights to drive better decision-making.

With a background in financial data analysis, stakeholder reporting, and client relationship management, I bring a practical, business-focused approach to working with data. Through my training at iO-Sphere and previous industry experience, I have developed strong technical and problem-solving skills, alongside the ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams.

I am passionate about helping organisations unlock the value of their data and am continuously building my knowledge to stay at the forefront of industry best practices
